Application based on the paper [`The Statistics of Statistical Arbitrage`](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228202799_The_Statistics_of_Statistical_Arbitrage) by Robert Fernholz. The application monitors market prices and periodically emits `position-intent`s to kafka. Unlike the linked paper, the application creates a net portfolio directly rather than constructing two portfolios (one with net-long exposure and one with net-short exposure). This modification reduces trading substantially, and allows for considerable "internal" leverage as the unlevered version usually trades less than 1% of the committed capital per day.
